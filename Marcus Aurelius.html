                    <span class="space"></span>How he came to the throne, however remains a mystery.Marcus Aurelius was born during the reign of Hadrian to the emperor's nephew,the praetor Marcus Annius Verus, and the  heiress Domitia Calvilla. His father died when he was three, and he was raised by his mother and paternal grandfather. After Hadrian's adoptive son, Aelius Caesar, died in 138, the emperor adopted Marcus's uncle Antoninus Pius as his new heir. In turn, Antoninus adopted Marcus and Lucius, the son of Aelius. Hadrian died that year, and Antoninus became emperor. Now heir to the throne, Marcus studied Greek and Latin under tutors such as Herodes Atticus and Marcus Cornelius Fronto. He married Antoninus' daughter Faustina in 145.

                <p><br>
                  <span class="space"></span>Marcus Aurelius would go on to be considered a great emperor in Roman history, not for any flashy accomplishments or grand achievements, but for his ability to administrate the empire without the usual Roman corruption. Aurelius was a strong administrator, who proved successful at identifying talent in others and surrounding himself with capable advisors. One such example is Pertinax, who came from humble beginnings, but was allowed to rise to the rank of general under Aurelius' rule. He proved an extremely capable military commander, and even went on to serve as Emperor for a brief three months later on.

                    <span class="space"></span>His greatest accomplishment as Emperor was his ability to hold the Empire togetherthrough the Roman Empire's first true pandemic, the Parthian War, and the GermanicWars. He was also able to navigate ruling with co-Emperor, Lucius Verus, his

                      Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.

                      If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.

                      Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with whom fate brings you together,but do so with all your heart.

                      Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.

                      If someone is able to show me that what I think or do is not right, I will happily change, for I seek the truth, by which no one was ever truly harmed. It is the person who continues in his self-deception and ignorance who is harmed.

                      Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize ?

                      I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others.

                    <li>
                      If it is not right do not do it; if it is not true do not say it.

                    <li>
                      The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority, but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                      Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself in your way of thinking.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                      When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling , ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly.They are like this because they can't tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.

                      Reject your sense of injury and the injury itself disappears.

                    <li>
                      Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.

                      How much more grievous are the consequences of anger  than the causes  of it.

                    <li>
                      The first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit. The second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are.

                    <li>
                      Do not act as if you were going to live ten thousand years. Death hangs over you. While you live, while it is in your power, be good.

                    <li>
                      Here is a rule to remember in future, when anything tempts you to feel bitter: not "This is misfortune," but "To bear this worthily is good fortune.

                    <li>
                      Look well into thyself; there is a source of strength which will always spring up if thou wilt always look.

                      How much time he gains who does not look to see what his neighbour says or does or thinks, but only at what he does himself, to make it just and holy.
